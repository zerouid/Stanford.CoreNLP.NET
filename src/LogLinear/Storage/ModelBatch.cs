	/// The idea here is pretty straightforward, but requires some explanation.
	/// <p>
	/// GraphicalModels are great for storing lots of metadata about the model, though storing full featurizations can be a
	/// bit slow.
	/// <p>
	/// With a ModelBatch, you can get your models from anywhere, and after running LENSE on them (which will add lots of
	/// annotations, potentially) you can write those models to disk in a big fat batch. Those models you've stored can be
	/// stored without featurizing them, as long as you keep enough metadata to be able to featurize later. Then when you
	/// load a batch from disk to run simulations, you can try out different feature sets and gameplayers, all while keeping
	/// the beautifully precomputed metadata for the model (including instructions for querying, and the query logs).
