	/// <remarks>
	/// Something that implements the <code>Label</code> interface can act as a
	/// constituent, node, or word label with linguistic attributes.
	/// A <code>Label</code> is required to have a "primary" <code>String</code>
	/// <code>value()</code> (although this may be null).  This is referred to as
	/// its <code>value</code>.
	/// <p>
	/// Implementations of Label split into two groups with
	/// respect to equality. Classes that extend ValueLabel define equality
	/// solely in terms of String equality of its value (secondary facets may be
	/// present but are ignored for purposes of equality), and have equals and
	/// compareTo defined across all subclasses of ValueLabel. This behavior
	/// should not be changed. Other classes that implement Label define equality only
	/// with their own type and require all fields of the type to be equal.
	/// <p>
	/// A subclass that extends another Label class <i>should</i> override
	/// the definition of <code>labelFactory()</code>, since the contract for
	/// this method is that it should return a factory for labels of the
	/// exact same object type.
