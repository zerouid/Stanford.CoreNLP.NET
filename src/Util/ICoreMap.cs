	/// Base type for all annotatable core objects. Should usually be instantiated as
	/// <see cref="ArrayCoreMap"/>
	/// . Many common key definitions live in
	/// <see cref="Edu.Stanford.Nlp.Ling.CoreAnnotations"/>
	/// , but others may be defined elsewhere. See
	/// <see cref="Edu.Stanford.Nlp.Ling.CoreAnnotations"/>
	/// for details.
	/// Note that implementations of this interface must take care to implement
	/// equality correctly: by default, two CoreMaps are .equal if they contain the
	/// same keys and all corresponding values are .equal. Subclasses that wish to
	/// change this behavior (such as
	/// <see cref="HashableCoreMap"/>
	/// ) must make sure that
	/// all other CoreMap implementations have a special case in their .equals to use
	/// that equality definition when appropriate. Similarly, care must be taken when
	/// defining hashcodes. The default hashcode is 37 * sum of all keys' hashcodes
	/// plus the sum of all values' hashcodes. However, use of this class as HashMap
	/// keys is discouraged because the hashcode can change over time. Consider using
	/// a
	/// <see cref="HashableCoreMap"/>
	/// .
