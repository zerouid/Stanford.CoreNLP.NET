	/// <summary>
	/// A
	/// <c>FileSequentialCollection</c>
	/// maintains a read-only
	/// collection of
	/// <c>Files</c>
	/// .  (It's a list, but we don't
	/// make it a List or else one needs an iterator that can go backwards.)
	/// It is built from a Collection of paths, or just from a single path.
	/// Optionally one can also provide a
	/// <c>FileFilter</c>
	/// which is
	/// applied over the files in a recursive traversal, or else
	/// an extension and whether to do recursive traversal, which are used to
	/// construct a filter.
	/// Note that the Collection argument constructor will behave 'normally'
	/// iff none of the Collection elements are directories.  If they are
	/// directories they will be recursed and files in them added.  To get the
	/// behavior of putting just directories in the collection one needs to
	/// use the constructor
	/// <c>FileSequentialCollection(c, failFilt, true)</c>
	/// ,
	/// where
	/// <c>failFilt</c>
	/// is a user-supplied
	/// <c>FileFilter</c>
	/// that accepts no files.
	/// The
	/// <c>FileSequentialCollection</c>
	/// builds from these
	/// constructor arguments a collection of
	/// <c>Files</c>
	/// , which can be
	/// iterated over, etc.  This class does runtime expansion of paths.
	/// That is, it is optimized for iteration and not for random access.
	/// It is also an unmodifiable Collection.
	/// The class provides some additional constructors beyond the two recommended
	/// by the Collections package, to allow specifying a
	/// <c>FileFilter</c>
	/// and similar options.  Nevertheless, so as to avoid overburdening the
	/// the API, not every possibly useful constructor has been provided where
	/// these can be easily synthesized using standard Collections package
	/// facilities.  Useful idioms to know are:
	/// <ul>
	/// <li>To make a
	/// <c>FileSequentialCollection</c>
	/// from an array of
	/// <c>Files</c>
	/// or
	/// <c>Strings</c>
	/// 
	/// <c>arr</c>
	/// :<br />
	/// <c>FileSequentialCollection fcollect = new FileSequentialCollection(Arrays.asList(arr));</c>
	/// </li>
	/// <li>To make a
	/// <c>FileSequentialCollection</c>
	/// from a single
	/// <c>File</c>
	/// or
	/// <c>String</c>
	/// fi:<br />
	/// <c>
	/// FileSequentialCollection fcollect =
	/// new FileSequentialCollection(Collections.singletonList(fi));
	/// </c>
	/// </li>
	/// </ul>
	/// This class will throw an
	/// <c>IllegalArgumentException</c>
	/// if there
	/// are things that are not existing Files or String paths to existing files
	/// in the input collection (from the Iterator).
