	/// <remarks>
	/// This class serves as the base class for classes which extract relevant
	/// information from a history to give it to the features. Every feature has
	/// an associated extractor or maybe more.  GlobalHolder keeps all the
	/// extractors; two histories are considered equal if all extractors return
	/// equal values for them.  The main functionality of the Extractors is
	/// provided by the method extract which takes a History as an argument.
	/// The Extractor looks at the history and takes out something important for
	/// the features - e.g. specific words and tags at specific positions or
	/// some function of the History. The histories are effectively vectors
	/// of values, with each dimension being the output of some extractor.
	/// <p>
	/// New extractors are created in either ExtractorFrames or
	/// ExtractorFramesRare; those are the places you want to consider
	/// adding your new extractor.  For a new Extractor, typically the things
	/// that you have to define are:
	/// <ul>
	/// <li>leftContext() and/or rightContext() if the extractor uses the tag
	/// sequence to the left or right (so that dynamic programming will be done
	/// correctly.
	/// <li>isLocal() Return true iff the function is only of the current word
	/// (for efficiency)
	/// <li>isDynamic() Return true if a function of any tags (for efficiency)
	/// <li>extract(History, PairsHolder) The actual function that returns the
	/// value for the feature.
	/// </ul>
	/// <p>
	/// Note that some extractors can be reused across multiple taggers,
	/// but many cannot.  Any extractor that uses information from the
	/// tagger such as its dictionary, for example, cannot.  For the
	/// moment, some of the extractors in ExtractorFrames and
	/// ExtractorFramesRare are static; those are all reusable at the
	/// moment, but if you change them in any way to make them not
	/// reusable, make sure to change the way they are constructed as well.
