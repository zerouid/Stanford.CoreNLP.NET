	/// <summary>A class for tree normalization.</summary>
	/// <remarks>
	/// A class for tree normalization.  The default one does no normalization.
	/// Other tree normalizers will change various node labels, or perhaps the
	/// whole tree geometry (by doing such things as deleting functional tags or
	/// empty elements).  Another operation that a
	/// <c>TreeNormalizer</c>
	/// may wish to perform is interning the
	/// <c>String</c>
	/// s passed to
	/// it.  Can be reused as a Singleton.  Designed to be extended.
	/// <p/>
	/// The
	/// <c>TreeNormalizer</c>
	/// methods are in two groups.
	/// The contract for this class is that first normalizeTerminal or
	/// normalizeNonterminal will be called on each
	/// <c>String</c>
	/// that will
	/// be put into a
	/// <c>Tree</c>
	/// , when they are read from files or
	/// otherwise created.  Then
	/// <c>normalizeWholeTree</c>
	/// will
	/// be called on the
	/// <c>Tree</c>
	/// .  It normally walks the
	/// <c>Tree</c>
	/// making whatever modifications it wishes to. A
	/// <c>TreeNormalizer</c>
	/// need not make a deep copy of a
	/// <c>Tree</c>
	/// .  It is assumed to be able to work destructively,
	/// because afterwards we will only use the normalized
	/// <c>Tree</c>
	/// .
	/// <p/>
	/// <i>Implementation note:</i> This is a very old legacy class used in conjunction
	/// with PennTreeReader.  It seems now that it would be better to move the
	/// String normalization into the tokenizer, and then we are just left with a
	/// (possibly destructive) TreeTransformer.
	/// </remarks>
