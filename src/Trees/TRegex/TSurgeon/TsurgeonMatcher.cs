	/// An object factored out to keep the state of a <code>Tsurgeon</code>
	/// operation separate from the <code>TsurgeonPattern</code> objects.
	/// This makes it easier to reset state between invocations and makes
	/// it easier to use in a threadsafe manner.
	/// <br />
	/// TODO: it would be nice to go through all the patterns and make sure
	/// they update <code>newNodeNames</code> or look for appropriate nodes
	/// in <code>newNodeNames</code> when possible.
	/// <br />
	/// It would also be nicer if the call to <code>matcher()</code> took
	/// the tree &amp; tregex instead of <code>evaluate()</code>, but that
	/// is a little more complicated because of the way the
	/// <code>TsurgeonMatcher</code> is used in <code>Tsurgeon</code>.
	/// Basically, you would need to move that code from
	/// <code>Tsurgeon</code> to <code>TsurgeonMatcher</code>.
