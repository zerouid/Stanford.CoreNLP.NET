	/// <summary>
	/// <c>EnglishGrammaticalRelations</c>
	/// is a
	/// set of
	/// <see cref="GrammaticalRelation"/>
	/// objects for the English language.
	/// These relations are commonly called Stanford Dependencies (SD).
	/// Grammatical relations can either be shown in their basic form, where each
	/// input token receives a relation, or "collapsed" which does certain normalizations
	/// which group words or turns them into relations. See
	/// <see cref="EnglishGrammaticalStructure"/>
	/// .  What is presented here mainly
	/// shows the basic form, though there is some mixture. The "collapsed" grammatical
	/// relations primarily differ as follows:
	/// <ul>
	/// <li>Some multiword conjunctions and prepositions are treated as single
	/// words, and then processed as below.</li>
	/// <li>Prepositions do not appear as words but are turned into new "prep" or "prepc"
	/// grammatical relations, one for each preposition.</li>
	/// <li>Conjunctions do not appear as words but are turned into new "conj"
	/// grammatical relations, one for each conjunction.</li>
	/// <li>The possessive "'s" is deleted, leaving just the relation between the
	/// possessor and possessum.</li>
	/// <li>Agents of passive sentences are recognized and marked as agent and not as prep_by.</li>
	/// </ul>
	/// <p/>
	/// This set of English grammatical relations is not intended to be
	/// exhaustive or immutable.  It's just where we're at now.
	/// <p/>
	/// <p/>
	/// See
	/// <see cref="GrammaticalRelation"/>
	/// for details of fields and matching.
	/// <p/>
	/// <p/>
	/// If using LexicalizedParser, it should be run with the
	/// <c>-retainTmpSubcategories</c>
	/// option and one of the
	/// <c>-splitTMP</c>
	/// options (e.g.,
	/// <c>-splitTMP 1</c>
	/// ) in order to
	/// get the temporal NP dependencies maximally right!
	/// <p/>
	/// <i>Implementation notes: </i> Don't change the set of GRs without discussing it
	/// with people first.  If a change is needed, to add a new grammatical relation:
	/// <ul>
	/// <li> Governor nodes of the grammatical relations should be the lowest ones.</li>
	/// <li> Check the semantic head rules in SemanticHeadFinder and
	/// ModCollinsHeadFinder, both in the trees package. That's what will be used to
	/// match here.</li>
	/// <li> Create and define the GrammaticalRelation similarly to the others.</li>
	/// <li> Add it to the
	/// <c>values</c>
	/// array at the end of the file.</li>
	/// </ul>
	/// The patterns in this code assume that an NP may be followed by either a
	/// -ADV or -TMP functional tag but there are no other functional tags represented.
	/// This corresponds to what we currently get from NPTmpRetainingTreeNormalizer or
	/// DependencyTreeTransformer.
