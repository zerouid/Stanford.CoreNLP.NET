	/// <remarks>
	/// This interface specifies language/treebank specific information for a
	/// Treebank, which a parser or other treebank user might need to know.
	/// Some of this is fixed for a (treebank,language) pair, but some of it
	/// reflects feature extraction decisions, so it can be sensible to have
	/// multiple implementations of this interface for the same
	/// (treebank,language) pair.
	/// So far this covers punctuation, character encodings, and characters
	/// reserved for label annotations.  It should probably be expanded to
	/// cover other stuff (unknown words?).
	/// Various methods in this class return arrays.  You should treat them
	/// as read-only, even though one cannot enforce that in Java.
	/// Implementations in this class do not call basicCategory() on arguments
	/// before testing them, so if needed, you should explicitly call
	/// basicCategory() yourself before passing arguments to these routines for
	/// testing.
	/// This class should be able to be an immutable singleton.  It contains
	/// data on various things, but no state.  At some point we should make it
	/// a real immutable singleton.
