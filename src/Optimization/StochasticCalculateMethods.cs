	/// This enumeratin was created to organize the selection of different methods for stochastic
	/// calculations.  It was also created for use with Stochastic Meta Descent (SMDMinimizer) due
	/// to the need for Hessian Vector Products, and the inefficiency of continuing to calculate these
	/// vector products in other minimization methods like Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGDMinimizer)
