	/// An interface that supports finding k best and/or k good
	/// parses and parse sampling.
	/// These operations are specified by separate methods,
	/// but it is expected that many parsers will return
	/// an UnsupportedOperationException for some of these methods.
	/// This has some other methods that essentially provide a rich
	/// parser interface which is used by certain parsers in lexparser,
	/// including other convenience methods like hasParse() and
	/// getBestScore().
